pillow, Krishnendu Biswas, 4, Good quality product, Dont panic if the product delivered is compressed. It is delivered in a vacuum compressed packing. After cutting it will take fluffy form. It is just a okay type product. But for a price of 400 .. it is just superb.READ MORE

pillow, Flipkart Customer, 5, Must buy!, Comfortable ! Value for money !!The pillow comes in a vacuum deflated packaging which looks like a pillow cover at first but bloats into a full pillow once unleashed. After 3 months of comprehensive use, I can say that pillow is comfortable and retains it's shape even though after long usage. Totally recommendableREAD MORE
